* Creative and inventive; I think in terms of possibility
* Practical and hands-on; I like to get things done, built, or made
* I love investigating situations -- often in a research or trouble-shooting capacity, prototyping and innovative product creation
* I like getting things done, including dealing with hands-on problems or situations,
* I enjoy being outdoors and doing tasks that are associated with being outdoors or away from the office - I enjoy being a road warrior in business development
* I like working with the written word, which may involve anything from documentation to the production of marketing materials and excel at making hard-hitting presentations
* I am straightforward and find it fairly easy to speak my mind, even with superiors
* I can think outside the box, and I'm never constrained by "how things ought to be done"
* I enjoy low-key discussions, where everyone's contribution can be heard
* I have certain abstract, personal values, which often I also show in the work I do
* I have a high energy level, and like to be busy doing things rather than thinking about them
* I'm generally logical and objective, able to get to the heart of the problem faster than people who are more emotional than I am in business situations, helps with solution creation
* I can concentrate my attentions on the task at hand
